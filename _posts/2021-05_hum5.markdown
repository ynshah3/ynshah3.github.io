In this argumentative essay, I view W. E. B. Du Bois' text <em>The Souls of Black Folk</em>, being an undertaking for racial equality for Black Americans, through the lens of Simone de Beauvoir and her text <em>The Second Sex</em>, which has become, arguably, a classic text for the advocation of gender equality for women.
