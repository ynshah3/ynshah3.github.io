In this paper, we explore using divisive normalization across neuronal sub-populations computing similar features, with and without an associated rectifier like ReLU, to enforce local competition. We create these neuronal sub-populations that compute similar features by sampling the weights for NxN convolutional filters from a multivariate N^2â€“dimensional gaussian distribution. Results are analyzed based on top-1 accuracy and computation speed on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
