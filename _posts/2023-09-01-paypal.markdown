Queried ~8M cards for various merchants using PostgreSQL and submitted for bulk network token enrollment. Analyzed 3-D secure transactions for 118 merchants and (1) enabled them to be processed through network tokenization first in production, (2) modified the way 3-D secure transactions are processed for certain processors and card types in the codebase so that future transactions can be directly processed through NT First.
