Enabled network tokenization first for payment transaction processing for PayPal's merchant partners to improve security and optimize authorization rates by around 40% for some merchants. Utilized data monitoring tools for monitoring code changes. Added a Foreign Tax ID Prompt to the Token Requestor ID (TRID) Onboarding UI to enable foreign merchants to apply for network tokenization.
