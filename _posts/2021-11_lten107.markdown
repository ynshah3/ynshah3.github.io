An exercise in creative and imaginative writing, this paper presents a poem that the Plowman in Geoffrey Chaucer's <em>The Canterbury Tales</em> could have sung if he were giving a speaking role. A possible theme, which this paper presents, is the Plowman's narration of the events of the Peasant's Revolt of 1381 and an attempt to "quite" Chaucer.
