    <p>(Chapter: &#8220;Headlights&#8221;)<br>&#8220;In the flat darkness of the countryside, there is only disappointment, a wedding dress, and a bathroom she shouldn't have taken so long in ...
    <em>It's them, they're back for us!</em>...
    She lights a cigarette and then, exhaling smoke, [Nené] adds: <em>It's them, yes. But they're coming back for him.</em>&#8221;<br><br>

    (Chapter: &#8220;The Test&#8221;)<br>&#8220;<em>Get out</em>, he says. I get out and he moves into the driver's seat. I peer in through the window and ask him what will happen now. <em>Nothing</em>, he says, <em>you hesitated</em>.&#8221;<br><br>

    (Chapter: &#8220;Heads Against Concrete&#8221;)<br>&#8220;My man, you're a mega-genius. A me-ga-ge-nius&#8221;<br><br>

    (Chapter: &#8220;Heads Against Concrete&#8221;)<br>&#8220;... I'm starting to think about what my mom always said, which is that the problem with the world is that it's in a great crisis of love. And also that, when it comes down to it, these are not good times for very sensitive people.&#8221;<br><br>

    (Chapter: &#8220;The Heavy Suitcase of Benavides&#8221;)<br>&#8220;Art is memorious, dear audience, and from the least likely molecules of this, our society, true artists majestically emerge.&#8221;

      &#8220;Our brains are constantly cataloging what we see: your brother comes in and you say &#8220;my brother just came into the house.&#8221; Everything is labeled and classified. But a monster comes in and you can't say &#8220;this is my brother;&#8221; you say &#8220;what is this?&#8221; Its eyes aren't where they should be, it's not the right height or color--so you are forced to really look at it for the first time. When you can achieve that effect with real objects, it creates a distance from our everyday lives that's extraordinary. The extraordinary exists in our gaze--not it the object we're looking at, and not in the text.&#8221;
